# A Twitter-esque Social Media Site
#### A Software Architecture Project

### Short

The site is called Hummingbird, and the idea for it was to be a small challenge for the semester for me to create a light visual "dupe" of the older version of Twitter, with a few small differences. As someone with an interest in website design, this was quite fun to develop, obviously, with quite a few hurdles along the way.


### Developmental Iterations
During the project, there were four developmental iterations, each having 2 to 3 focus points, as per the requirement of the project for a single person. They go as follows:

#### Iteration I:
- The registration and login features for users;
- User authorisation (distinguishing roles, such as registered user, an unregistered guest and and admin);
- Creation of the administration panel (CRUD functionalities).
#### Iteration II:
- Creation of the main page (dynamic loading of the posts, sorted by creation date - newest to oldest);
- Implementation of the ability for a registered user to create a post.
#### Iteration III:
- Implementation of the delete and edit functionality for user's own posts;
- Addition of a comment section under every post, with the ability for users to leave comments.
#### Iteration IV:
- Implementation of the delete and edit functionality for user's own comments;
- Implementation of the "liking" feature for posts and comments;
- Making the comment section sorted by the given criteria:
  - Primary sorting based on the rating (amount of "likes" given) for each comment;
  - In case of a matching rating, the oldest comment will be displayed first, with newest comments displayed last.
